Interface specification between larpix-control and FPGA
=======================================================

This specification defines how the FPGA will interpret data sent by the
larpix-control software and vice versa.

Communications will consist of 10-byte packets with the following
structure:

Byte 0: Start byte 0x__ (to be defined by Thorsten)

Byte 1: FPGA metadata. Bits [3:0] give the I/O line ID (aka daisy
chain ID). For data sent to the FPGA, this tells the FPGA which line
(group of chips) to write to. For data sent from the FPGA, this tells
larpix-control which line (group of chips) the FPGA read from. Bits
[7:4] are reserved.

Bytes 2-8: LArPix UART data, aka the data payload to/from LArPix, with
the following structure:

  Byte 2: UART[7:0]
  Byte 3: UART[15:8]
  .
  .
  Byte 7: UART[47:40]
  Byte 8: Bits [5:0] contain UART[53:48]. Bits [7:6] are reserved.

Byte 9: End byte 0x__ (to be defined by Thorsten)

Error cases
-----------

1. Byte 0 is not the start byte.

2. Byte 9 is not the end byte.

In both of these cases, ignore all incoming data until a start byte
followed by 8 bytes followed by an end byte is received (since those 10
bytes constitute a complete packet).

There is currently no error correction or acknowledgement of receipt.
