Interface specification between larpix-control and FPGA
=======================================================

This specification defines how the FPGA will interpret data sent by the
larpix-control software and vice versa.

# larpix-control to FPGA

Communications will consist of 10-byte packets with the following
structure:

Byte 0: Start byte 0x73 (aka 's')

Bytes 1-7: LArPix UART data, aka the data payload to/from LArPix, with
the following structure:

  Byte 1: UART[7:0]
  Byte 2: UART[15:8]
  .
  .
  Byte 6: UART[47:40]
  Byte 7: Bits [5:0] contain UART[53:48]. Bits [7:6] are reserved.

Byte 8: Reserved

Byte 9: Quit byte 0x71 (aka 'q')

## Error cases

1. Byte 0 is not the start byte.

2. Byte 9 is not the quit byte.

In both of these cases, ignore all incoming data until a start byte
followed by 8 bytes followed by an end byte is received (since those 10
bytes constitute a complete packet).

There is currently no error correction or acknowledgement of receipt.

# FPGA to larpix-control

Communications will consist of 8-byte packets with the following
structure:

Bytes 0-6: LArPix UART data, in the same form as above.

Byte 7: Comma byte 0x0D (aka '\r' aka CR)

## Error cases

1. Byte 7 is not the quit byte

In this case, ignore all incoming data until a comma byte followed by 7
bytes followed by a comma byte is received. Ignore the first comma byte,
and then the 7 + 1 bytes constitute a complete packet.
